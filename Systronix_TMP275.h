/** TODO LIST

Function to get current temp in degrees C TMP102_GetTempC (uint16_t *data16)
Change constants and add a function to config so it can be something like
TMP102_Setup(TMP102_ONE_SHOT) or (TMP102_4HZ)

/** --------  Description ------------------------------------------------------

See the data sheet at http://www.ti.com/product/tmp102

Max operating temperature range is –55 to +150 °C, but to read this requires 
the non-default, 13-bit data format. The "specified range" in the data sheet
is -40 to 125 C, so the extended range accuracy is not guaranteed.
Accuracy from –25°C to +85°C is 0.5/2°C typ/max.
Accuracy from –40°C to +125°C is 1/3°C typ/max.
Accuracy from –55°C to +150°C is not specified. I plan to compare to a thermocouple
and see what some typical accuracies are.

One lsb is 0.0625°C in both 12- and 13-bit formats. The 13-bit mode just gives 
you a greater range over which you can use the sensor.
Negative numbers are binary twos complement format.

Aren't there other TMP102 libs? Yes, sort of:
There are other TMP102 Arduino libs out there but all those I found were very 
limited. I needed the full 13-bit data and temperature range support, multiple
devices per I2C net and so forth.

/** -------- Arduino Device and Version Testing and Issues ---------------------

This library assumes Arduino greater than 1.00, with Wire.read() and Wire.write()

This library was developed and tested on Teensy2, Teensy++2 (with AVR controllers)
and Teensy3 (ARM Cortex-M4??? is that correct?).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/


/** --------  Device Addressing --------
TMP102 base address is 0x48 (B 1001 000x) where x is R/W

This is confusing because the address part is just the the upper 7 bits, so if considered
alone, and right-justified, that is  B 0100 1000 which is 0x48 which is how Arduino wants it.
if ADDR is GND, address is 0x48
if ADDR is VDD, address is 0x49
if ADDR is SDA, address is 0x4A
if ADDR is SCL, address is 0x4B

/** --------  Register Addresses --------
The two lsb of the pointer register hold the register bits, which
are used to address one of the four directly-accessible registers.

There are four pointer addresses:
00  Temperature Register (Read Only) 12-13 bits in ms position
	bit 0 in LS byte is 1 if in 13-bit 'extended mode' (EM)
	If temp is positive (msb=0) the value is just the binary value.
	If temp is negative (msb=0) the value is in 2's complement form,
	so take the whole binary value, complement it, and add 1.
01  Configuration Register (Read/Write) 16 bits, MSB first
10  TLOW Limit Register (Read/Write)
11  THIGH Limit Register (Read/Write)

I have used the same designation as the data sheet, to be consistent,
instead of making names longer and perhaps more readable;
for example TMP102_CFG_AL = 'AL', the Alert config bit
