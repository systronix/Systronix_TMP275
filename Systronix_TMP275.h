Function to get current temp in degrees C TMP275_GetTempC (uint16_t *data16)

/** --------  Description ------------------------------------------------------

This library is based on the TMP275 library. The TMP275 is very similar. Here are 
the differences of TMP275:

- resolution is the same: .0625 °C per count in 12-bit mode, but the TMP275 adds a 
13-bit mode so that it can extend that resolution over a wider range –55 to +150 °C
- TMP275 accuracy is much better
- TMP275 has 8 possible slave address vs TMP275 4 
- TMP275 costs a bit more

See the data sheet at http://www.ti.com/product/tmp275
This lbrary based on data sheet rev E, 2015 Nov, document SBOS363E.

Max operating temperature range is -40 to +125 °C

TODO: update these to '275 values
Accuracy from –25°C to +85°C is 0.5/2°C typ/max.
Accuracy from –40°C to +125°C is 1/3°C typ/max.
Accuracy from –55°C to +150°C is not specified. I plan to compare to a thermocouple
and see what some typical accuracies are.

One lsb is 0.0625°C in 12-bit format. 
Negative numbers are binary twos complement format.

/** --------  Device Addressing --------
TMP275 base address is 0x48 (B 1001 000x) where x is R/W

This is confusing because the address part is just the the upper 7 bits, so if considered
alone, and right-justified, that is  B 0100 1000 which is 0x48 which is how Arduino wants it.
If A[2..0] are low, base is 0x48. If A[2..0] are 100, base is 0x4C.
If A[2..0] are high, base is 0x4F, the max

The two lsb of the pointer register hold the register bits, which
are used to address one of the four directly-accessible registers.

There are four pointer addresses:

	If temp is positive (msb=0) the value is just the binary value.
	If temp is negative (msb=0) the value is in 2's complement form,
	so take the whole binary value, complement it, and add 1.
01  Configuration Register (Read/Write) 8 bits, MSB first
10  TLOW Limit Register (Read/Write) POR = 80 deg C
11  THIGH Limit Register (Read/Write) POR = 75 deg C

and write to the config register for the desired option
This is an 8-bit register, bits 7..0 
I have used the same designation as the data sheet, to be consistent,
instead of making names longer and perhaps more readable;
for example TMP275_CFG_AL = 'AL', the Alert config bit
